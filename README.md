# THP-1_polarization
workflow to produce the report of the polarization of THP-1 shRNASET2
The cells used are a pool of stable silenced THP-1 cells silenced for the expression of hRNASET2.

Differentiation and poarization protocol:
For differentiation seed 1.3*10^6 cells in each well (MT6) with RPMI, 10% FBS (decomplemented), 1%Gln, 0.3 µg/mL puromycin,  5 ng/ml PMA. Incubate for 48 h in humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO2); During the process of differentiation verify the morphology of the cells.
For polarization discard the medium, wash 3 times with PBS and add fresh medium (RPMI + 5 % FBS (decomplemented) + 1 % L- Gln + 0.3 µg/ml puromicina) with the polarizing stimuli: 

•	M1 : 100 ng/mL LPS + 20 ng/mL INF gamma (2*10^5 IU/mg)

•	M2 : 20 ng/mL IL-4 (5*10^6 IU/mg)

•	MX : 20 ng/mL IL-4 (5*10^6 IU/mg) + 100 ng/mL LPS + 20 ng/mL INF gamma (2*10^5 IU/mg)

Incubate for 24 hours in humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) then proceed with total RNA extraction.

MX are used as positive control of the ability to change the polarization profile of M1 and M2 macrophages.

The genes used as marker for polarization are:

•	M1 : TNF, CXCL10, CCL19

•	M2 : CCL22, MRC1, MSR1
